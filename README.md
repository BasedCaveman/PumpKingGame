## Overview

**PumpKingGame** (working title) is a quick, fun side-project where you:
1. Move left/right to collect crowns for points.
2. Avoid coins (reset your score) and rugs (cost a life).
3. Earn extra lives by collecting enough crowns and by using the special **Red Halo** mechanic.
4. Survive as long as possible!

## Gameplay

- **Lives**: Start with 6.
- **Crowns** (üëë): +1 point each.
- **Coins** (‚ôé, üá∑üá∫, üí∏): On collision, your score resets to **0**.
- **Rugs** (üßª): On collision, your score resets **0** and you lose **1 life**.
- **Red Halo** mechanic spawns after avoiding 69 rugs in a row.
- After **420 points**, it gets more difficult (fewer crowns, faster speeds, more frequent rugs).
- Game Over => Displays **"RUGGED AGAIN"**.
